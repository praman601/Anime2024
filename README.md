This is a python project for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Anime_List_2024 dataset. Key libraries such as Pandas played a crucial role in data cleaning and transformation, allowing for efficient handling of the dataset's 1000 rows and 23 columns. Pandas provided functions for tasks such as column removal, renaming, whitespace removal, and data type conversion, ensuring that the dataset was properly prepared for analysis. Additionally, visualization was a vital aspect of the EDA process, and Matplotlib was instrumental in creating informative visualizations such as pair plots and bar plots. These visualizations helped uncover relationships between variables like popularity, score, and number of members, providing valuable insights into the characteristics of the top anime of 2024. Furthermore, Jupyter Notebook served as the development environment for executing Python code and documenting the analysis process, offering an interactive platform for exploration and presentation of findings. Overall, Python, along with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, formed the technological backbone of this EDA project, enabling comprehensive analysis and visualization of the Anime_List_2024 dataset.
